# MCP Server Pool ID Resolution - Complete Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed the MCP server to correctly replicate VSCode extension functionality, particularly around pool ID resolution and API method alignment with the Azure Function backend.

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Pool ID Resolution
**Problem**: MCP server was sending regular app IDs instead of pool IDs (64-character hex strings) to the backend.
**Solution**: Implemented `getPoolIdFromAppIdIfAvailable()` method in WorkspaceManager and applied it across all handlers.

### 2. HTTP Method Mismatches
**Problem**: Several API endpoints were using incorrect HTTP methods compared to VSCode extension.
**Solutions**:
- `checkApp`: Changed from POST to GET
- `getConsumption`: Changed from POST to GET
- `syncIds`: Added PATCH method support for merge mode
- `authorizeApp`: Added GET method for fetching auth info
- `deauthorizeApp`: Added DELETE method support

### 3. Missing API Functionality
**Problem**: Several API methods were missing or incomplete.
**Solutions Added**:
- `getAuthInfo()`: GET authorization info for an app
- `deauthorizeApp()`: DELETE to remove authorization
- `storeAssignment()`: POST/DELETE for managing ID assignments
- `autoSyncIds()`: Batch sync with POST (replace) or PATCH (merge)
- `checkUpdate()` and `check()`: Polling endpoints for real-time updates

### 4. Payload Enhancements
- `getConsumption`: Added `_total` field calculation
- `getNext`: Added `limitRanges()` logic for perRange + require scenarios
- `authorizeApp`: Enhanced response with user and valid fields

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
1. **mcp-server/src/lib/backend/BackendService.ts**
   - Fixed HTTP methods for all endpoints
   - Added missing API methods
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

2. **mcp-server/src/lib/workspace/WorkspaceManager.ts**
   - Added `appPoolId` field to WorkspaceApp interface
   - Implemented `getPoolIdFromAppIdIfAvailable()` method with validation

3. **mcp-server/src/server.ts**
   - Applied pool ID resolution to all handlers:
     - handleGetNextObjectId
     - handleAuthorizeApp
     - handleSyncObjectIds
     - handleGetConsumptionReport

4. **mcp-server/src/lib/polling/PollingService.ts**
   - Added pool ID resolution for polling updates
   - Fixed type issues with separate Maps for different data types

5. **mcp-server/src/lib/types/AuthorizationInfo.ts**
   - Extended interface with user and valid fields

### Test Coverage
1. **mcp-server/tests/backend/PoolIdResolution.test.ts** (New)
   - Comprehensive tests for all BackendService methods
   - Tests HTTP methods, payloads, and pool ID usage
   - Tests polling endpoints with and without configuration

2. **mcp-server/tests/backend/SyncModes.test.ts** (New)
   - Tests for sync mode functionality (PATCH vs POST)

3. **mcp-server/tests/server/PoolIdHandlers.test.ts** (New)
   - Tests server handlers use pool ID resolution correctly

## API Methods Verified Against Azure Backend

All methods now correctly match the Azure Function App implementation:

| Method | Endpoint | HTTP Method | Pool ID Support |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| checkApp | /api/v2/checkApp | GET | ✅ |
| getNext | /api/v2/getNext | GET/POST | ✅ |
| authorizeApp | /api/v2/authorizeApp | POST | ✅ |
| getAuthInfo | /api/v2/authorizeApp | GET | ✅ |
| deauthorizeApp | /api/v2/authorizeApp | DELETE | ✅ |
| syncIds | /api/v2/syncIds | POST/PATCH | ✅ |
| autoSyncIds | /api/v2/autoSyncIds | POST/PATCH | ✅ |
| storeAssignment | /api/v2/storeAssignment | POST/DELETE | ✅ |
| getConsumption | /api/v2/getConsumption | GET | ✅ |
| createPool | /api/v2/createPool | POST | N/A |
| joinPool | /api/v2/joinPool | POST | N/A |
| leavePool | /api/v2/leavePool | POST | ✅ |
| checkUpdate | /api/v2/check | GET | ✅ |
| check | /api/v2/check | GET | ✅ |

## Pool ID Validation Logic
```typescript
// Pool IDs must be 64-character hexadecimal strings
if (appPoolId.length !== 64 || !/^[0-9A-Fa-f]{64}$/.test(appPoolId)) {
  return appId; // Return regular ID if pool ID is invalid
}
```

## Testing Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ 20 tests in PoolIdResolution.test.ts
- ✅ 5 tests in SyncModes.test.ts
- ✅ 4 tests in PoolIdHandlers.test.ts
- ✅ Integration tests pass

## Key Takeaways
1. MCP server now exactly replicates VSCode extension behavior
2. Pool ID resolution ensures proper app identification in shared pools
3. HTTP methods align with Azure backend expectations
4. Comprehensive test coverage validates all changes
5. Polling endpoints gracefully handle missing configuration
